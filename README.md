### Team 1 (Rahma elsayed - Ebrahem Karm - Shahd Shabaan)

#### 1. libraries
   * pygame
   * sys: built in system library
   
#### 2. Objects.
   * 2 sprites (cat (red) - mouse (gray))
   * background (congratulations.jpg)
   * boxes that sprites move on it (water - bridge - land)
#### 3. How program work?
   * at first case (random moving at (main_2.py))
   The program works automatically without any intervention. When the mouse touches the water or the cat, the game restarts automatically, but if it reaches the bridge, it wins and displays the winning screen.
   * at second case (keys moving at (main.py))
   The program works by the user as shown in the attached video. The program works with the arrows, and when you press the upper arrow, the mouse moves to the top, and so on with the bottom, right and left, and when the mouse touches the cat or touches the water, it loses and restarts the game automatically, but if it reaches the bridge, it gains and displays the winning screen.
